###     - Color Modes
 - [ ] Styling is using the Materialize framework, this should be removed and have the themed style applied(this really only relates to the button but I thought it was worth mentioning)
 - [ ] The top circle and left circle move apart when they overlap but the right one wonâ€™t until all three are overlapping
###     - Color Input
 - [x] Looks good.
###     - Palette Generator
 - [ ] Every time we click a new palette is generated no matter where we are clicking, this should be restricted to a button.
